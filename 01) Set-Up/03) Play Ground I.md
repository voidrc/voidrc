now we set up our main machine. are we ready to go out and test the limits of law?  
**ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT.**

what you gonna do without training? flex with `_cmatrix_` someone else wrote? sit down. here’s your cure:  
➡️ go to [HackMyVM](https://hackmyvm.eu), grab dummy targets, and break them guilt-free.  
but first — never run live malware straight on your main rig unless you enjoy reinstalling arch at 3am. 

my advice: build a **sandbox**.

since i roll with **cachyos**, guide is tuned for that. if you use another distro… cope.

## Virtual Box
type 2 hyprvisor, complete isolation, commonly used, but resource heavy

> KVM or ProxMox VE can be considered type 1 hyprvisors.

now go kick ass in that fake os in your virtualbox — break shit, respawn snaps, and keep your real rig unscathed.
