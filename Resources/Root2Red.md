- **CompTIA Network+**
	- Validates Foundational Networking Knowledge
	- [Official Link](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/network/)

#### **[Build Home Lab]**
- **Tools**: 
	- VirtualBox
	- ProxMox VE
- **Tasks**
	- Linux Server
	- Windows Server with Active Directory
	- Simulate Networking (Use Packet Tracer to map out)

#### **[Portfolio / Resume]**
- Highlight hands-on experience from your lab.
- Showcase any scripts or projects on GitHub.
- Include certifications in your resume.
#### **[Job / Application Plan]**
- **Targets**:
	- **Junior System Administrator / SysAdmin**
	- **IT Support Specialist / Helpdesk Technician**
	- **Network Support Technician**
	- **Infrastructure Technician / NOC Technician**
	- **Cloud Support Associate / Cloud Ops Technician**
- **Companies**:
	- **MSP (Managed Service Providers)**
	- **Mid-size companies (100–500 employees)**
	- **Government / Edu sector**
	- **Hosting providers / datacenters**
	- **Tech startups**
- **Platforms**:
	- **LinkedIn Jobs** - the default hunting ground. recruiters live here.
	- **Indeed** - massive listings, but you have to filter hard.
	- **Glassdoor**: - useful for checking salary ranges and company culture before applying. not great for finding _new_ roles, but excellent for filtering bad employers.
	- **ZipRecruiter**: - strong for smaller companies and MSPs. it syndicates listings from other boards too, so you’ll see overlap but catch a few extra gems.
	- **Dice** - geared toward tech pros. solid for sysadmin, NOC, and DevOps-adjacent jobs. has recruiter outreach features that work surprisingly well.
	- **AngelList (now Wellfound)** - for startup environments — if you want to learn fast and touch multiple systems. startups often skip degree/cert requirements if you can _show_ skill.
	- **Reddit**: r/sysadminjobs, r/techjobs
	- **Discord / Slack groups**: sysadmin communities often share private listings.
	- **Company career pages**: smaller orgs post directly, especially local ISPs, MSPs, universities, or government IT departments.
	- **[Microsoft Learn Career Connected](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/careerconnected)** - lets you match your Microsoft cert progress to open job listings
