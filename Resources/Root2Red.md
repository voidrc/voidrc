#### **[Portfolio / Resume]**

- Highlight hands-on experience from your lab.
- Showcase any scripts or projects on GitHub.
- Include certifications in your resume.

#### **[Job / Application Plan]**

- **Targets**:
  - **Junior System Administrator / SysAdmin**
  - **IT Support Specialist / Helpdesk Technician**
  - **Network Support Technician**
  - **Infrastructure Technician / NOC Technician**
  - **Cloud Support Associate / Cloud Ops Technician**
- **Companies**:
  - **MSP (Managed Service Providers)**
  - **Mid-size companies (100–500 employees)**
  - **Government / Edu sector**
  - **Hosting providers / datacenters**
  - **Tech startups**
- **Platforms**:
  - **LinkedIn Jobs** - the default hunting ground. recruiters live here.
  - **Indeed** - massive listings, but you have to filter hard.
  - **Glassdoor**: - useful for checking salary ranges and company culture before applying. not great for finding _new_ roles, but excellent for filtering bad employers.
  - **ZipRecruiter**: - strong for smaller companies and MSPs. it syndicates listings from other boards too, so you’ll see overlap but catch a few extra gems.
  - **Dice** - geared toward tech pros. solid for sysadmin, NOC, and DevOps-adjacent jobs. has recruiter outreach features that work surprisingly well.
  - **AngelList (now Wellfound)** - for startup environments — if you want to learn fast and touch multiple systems. startups often skip degree/cert requirements if you can _show_ skill.
  - **Reddit**: r/sysadminjobs, r/techjobs
  - **Discord / Slack groups**: sysadmin communities often share private listings.
  - **Company career pages**: smaller orgs post directly, especially local ISPs, MSPs, universities, or government IT departments.
  - **[Microsoft Learn Career Connected](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/careerconnected)** - lets you match your Microsoft cert progress to open job listings
