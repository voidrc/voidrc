Bug hunting focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in websites and applications.

The goal is to find and responsibly report bugs, ranging from information disclosure to injection vulnerabilities.

For example, information disclosure may expose parts of an application’s source code. On its own, this might not seem critical, but when combined with other vulnerabilities, it can become catastrophic.

Another example is broken access control, which can allow one user to access another user’s data.

After a bug is found, the next step is reporting it. A well-written, clear, and professional bug report often leads to higher rewards.

Once a reward is received, you can continue testing the same application for more issues or move on to a new target.

In short, the bug hunting cycle looks like this:

- Find a target with a bug bounty program
    
- Discover vulnerabilities
    
- Report them effectively
    
- Receive your reward
    
- Keep hunting or move on
