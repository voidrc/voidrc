Cybersecurity is a long learning journey, and it never truly ends. Even experienced professionals pause, study something new, and then return to continue their work with better understanding.

A simple example of this is the following [lab](https://portswigger.net/web-security/information-disclosure/exploiting/lab-infoleak-in-version-control-history).

When you run an automated scanner against the lab URL, you may discover a directory named `.git`. If you don’t know what it is, the correct approach is to stop, research it, understand how it works, and then come back to the lab with new knowledge.

If you’re still unsure, here is a brief explanation.

### What is `.git`?

`.git` is a hidden directory created by **Git**, a distributed version control system.  
It stores the complete history of a project, including commits, branches, configuration files, and metadata. This directory allows Git to track changes, revert files, and manage different versions of a codebase.

### How is `.git` used in real life?

In real-world development, `.git` is used by developers to:

- Track changes to source code over time
- Collaborate with other developers safely
- Roll back to previous versions when something breaks
- Maintain separate branches for features, testing, and production

The `.git` directory is meant to stay **private** and should never be accessible from a public web server. If it is exposed, attackers may be able to reconstruct the entire source code, discover secrets, credentials, or sensitive logic, and chain this information with other vulnerabilities.

This is why finding an exposed `.git` directory during testing is a serious **information disclosure vulnerability**.

### **Solution:**

Now that we know `.git` is created by **Git**, solving the lab requires obtaining a copy of that directory. Since `.git` is accessible and exposed as a directory, we can download it using `wget` with the recursive option:
```bash
wget -r lab_url
```
This gives us a local copy of the `.git` directory. Once downloaded, we can interact with it using Git commands to inspect the repository.

By reviewing the commit history, we can uncover useful information, including previously deleted files. In this case, the commit history reveals a password that was removed from the code, which can then be used to complete the lab.
