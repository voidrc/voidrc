# Operating Systems

in **cyber security**, the OS is just another weapon. there’s no “one distro to rule them all.” kali might be hyped, but locking yourself into it is like bringing the same lockpick to every door. boring. predictable.

**rule #1:** use what feels right.  
any OS can be hardened, any distro can be sharpened. hell, even a ‘90s tv can be hacked into a rig if you’re insane enough 👀

## the fast-food hacker menu

don’t wanna build from scratch yet? here’s the quick-serve list of preloaded pentest/anonymity toys:

**mainstream**
- **Kali Linux** → debian, tool-packed, overhyped. bloated but solid.
- **Parrot Security** → lighter, stealthier cousin.
- **BlackArch** → arch-based arsenal, brutal for beginners.
- **BackBox** → ubuntu-based, minimal, clean.
- **Pentoo** → gentoo fork, masochist-only.
- **Fedora Security Spin** → fedora remix, tuned with security & forensic tools. clean GNOME desktop, great for learning pentest workflows.

**anonymity**
- **Tails** → amnesiac live OS, tor baked in.
- **Whonix** → tor gateway VM style.
- **Qubes OS** → compartmentalized VMs, heavy but powerful.

**specialists**
- **CAINE / DEFT** → forensics rigs.

## my build (proof of concept)

forget premade. i run **arch** (via cachyos kernel) with:
- **Hyprland (HyDE dots)** → polished tiling + aesthetics.
- **BlackArch repo** → instant pentest toolbox.

result: a **high-performance, arsenal-loaded, slick-looking machine** tuned exactly to me.

## where to next

if you’re serious, don’t worship distros — learn to build and break your own.  
i’ve dumped **hundreds of [linux notes](../Linux/01.%20Installing%20Distro.md)** in the dedicated folder. go there. grind. experiment.
