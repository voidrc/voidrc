## File System Overview

The **file system** defines how data is organized, stored, and retrieved on a storage device.  
It acts as the logical structure that manages files and directories within a partition.

### **Core Concept**

Everything in Linux is treated as a **file**.

- Regular documents and executables are files.
- **Devices** like USB drives, network adapters, and hard disks appear as files (usually under `/dev`).
- Even **directories** are a special type of file containing references to other files.
- If something isn’t a file, it’s a **process**.

This unified approach allows Linux to manage hardware and software resources consistently through file operations.

### **Hierarchical Structure**

The Linux file system follows a **tree-like hierarchy**, beginning at the **root directory (`/`)**.  
All other directories branch out from `/`, forming the base of the file structure.

Example layout:

```
/
├── bin
├── etc
├── home
├── var
└── usr
```

> Each directory serves a specific purpose — `/home` for user data, `/etc` for configuration files, `/bin` for essential binaries, and so on. _[FHS]()_

### **“Folder” vs “Directory”**

- **Directory** is the traditional UNIX/Linux term, commonly used in terminal (TTY) environments.
- **Folder** is a graphical (GUI) term referring to the same concept.
- They are **interchangeable** in meaning — both represent containers that hold files and subdirectories.

## **Filesystem Hierarchy Standart**

```json
/        => Root directory — the top of the Linux file system hierarchy.
/bin     => Contains essential user executables available to all users.
/sbin    => Contains system binaries and administrative commands (for superuser).
        (In CachyOS, both /bin and /sbin are linked to /usr/bin)
/boot    => Holds files required to boot the system, including the kernel and bootloader.
/home    => Contains individual user directories.
/root    => The home directory of the root (superuser).
/dev     => Contains device files representing hardware and peripherals.
/etc     => Stores system-wide configuration files and startup scripts.
/lib     => Contains shared libraries needed by essential binaries.
/lib64   => 64-bit variant of /lib.
        (In CachyOS, both are linked to /usr/lib)
/media   => Used for mounting external storage devices automatically.
        (In CachyOS, auto-mounting occurs under /run/media, but you can configure mounts manually via /etc/fstab)
/mnt     => Temporary mount point for filesystems or external devices.
/tmp     => Stores temporary files, often cleared on reboot.
/proc    => Virtual filesystem providing runtime system information (e.g., hardware, kernel, processes).
/sys     => Virtual filesystem containing kernel objects, drivers, and hardware details.
/srv     => Contains data served by system services (like web or FTP servers).
/run     => Temporary filesystem stored in RAM for runtime process information.
/usr     => Contains most user utilities, applications, and system resources.
/var     => Contains variable data files like logs, caches, and spool files.
```

> `~` represents the current user’s home directory.  
> `cat /proc/cpuinfo` — displays detailed information about your CPU.
