## File System Overview

The **file system** defines how data is organized, stored, and retrieved on a storage device.  
It acts as the logical structure that manages files and directories within a partition.

### **Core Concept**

Everything in Linux is treated as a **file**.

- Regular documents and executables are files.
- **Devices** like USB drives, network adapters, and hard disks appear as files (usually under `/dev`).
- Even **directories** are a special type of file containing references to other files.
- If something isn’t a file, it’s a **process**.

This unified approach allows Linux to manage hardware and software resources consistently through file operations.

### **Hierarchical Structure**

The Linux file system follows a **tree-like hierarchy**, beginning at the **root directory (`/`)**.  
All other directories branch out from `/`, forming the base of the file structure.

Example layout:

```
/
├── bin
├── etc
├── home
├── var
└── usr
```

> Each directory serves a specific purpose — `/home` for user data, `/etc` for configuration files, `/bin` for essential binaries, and so on. _[FHS]()_

### **“Folder” vs “Directory”**

- **Directory** is the traditional UNIX/Linux term, commonly used in terminal (TTY) environments.
- **Folder** is a graphical (GUI) term referring to the same concept.
- They are **interchangeable** in meaning — both represent containers that hold files and subdirectories.

## **Filesystem Hierarchy Standart**

| Directory | Purpose                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`       | Root directory — the top of the Linux filesystem hierarchy |
| `/bin`    | Essential user executables available to all users          |
| `/sbin`   | System binaries and administrative commands (superuser)    |
| `/boot`   | Bootloader files and the Linux kernel                      |
| `/home`   | Home directories for regular users                         |
| `/root`   | Home directory for the root (superuser)                    |
| `/dev`    | Device files representing hardware and peripherals         |
| `/etc`    | System-wide configuration files and startup scripts        |
| `/lib`    | Shared libraries required by essential binaries            |
| `/lib64`  | 64-bit libraries (architecture-specific)                   |
| `/media`  | Mount points for removable media (USB, external drives)    |
| `/mnt`    | Temporary mount point for filesystems                      |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary files (often cleared on reboot)                  |
| `/proc`   | Virtual filesystem exposing process and kernel info        |
| `/sys`    | Virtual filesystem for kernel objects and hardware         |
| `/srv`    | Data served by system services (web, FTP, etc.)            |
| `/run`    | Runtime process data stored in RAM                         |
| `/usr`    | User applications, binaries, libraries, documentation      |
| `/var`    | Variable data (logs, caches, spool files)                  |


> `~` represents the current user’s home directory.  
> `cat /proc/cpuinfo` — displays detailed information about your CPU.
