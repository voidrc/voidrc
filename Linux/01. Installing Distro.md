> if you’ve never touched linux and still rely on windows or mac, start safe. using **VirtualBox** is recommended. check tutorials for installing VirtualBox on your system first.

so there are plenty of linux distros to choose from, and they all work almost the same — with a few key differences. in this folder i’ll guide using **Kali Linux**, but you can choose any distro according to your liking. if you haven’t chosen one yet, check the decision tree below.

- **you want convenience & preloaded pentest tools** → Kali Linux, Parrot Security
- **you want a clean, stable, rpm/fedora-based option with security tools** → Fedora Security Spin
- **you want a modular, minimal, user-built system** → Arch (with an optional BlackArch repo for pentest tools)
- **you want a huge toolset and are comfortable with pacman/arch** → BlackArch
- **you want a lightweight, ubuntu-based entry** → BackBox
- **you want to learn compiling and fine-grained control** → Pentoo (Gentoo derived)
- **you need strong anonymity & amnesia** → Tails (live), Whonix (VM gateway), Qubes (isolation-first)
- **you’re focused on forensics** → CAINE, DEFT

> installation of distros may differ too, so check tutorials for that

environment checklist (before you install):

- **decide: VM or bare-metal?**
  - vm (virtualbox / qemu+virt-manager): safer for testing, easy snapshots.
  - bare-metal: better hardware performance, riskier if you’re still learning.
- **hardware basics**
  - CPU: virtualization support (VT-x / AMD-V) enabled in BIOS/UEFI.
  - ram: 8GB min for comfortable VMs; 16GB+ for heavy multitasking or Qubes.
