> To prevent a command from being saved in your shell history, prefix the command with a leading space. This behavior can vary between distributions and shells; it’s governed by the `HISTCONTROL` variable.
> 
> Set `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` to ignore commands that start with a space.
> 
> `HISTCONTROL=ignoredups` — ignore duplicate entries.
> 
> `HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth` — ignore both leading-space commands and duplicates.
