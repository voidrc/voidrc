- **`history`** — displays the list of previously executed commands, each with an identifying number.
- **`!<number>`** — executes the command corresponding to that history number.
- **`!<-n>`** — re-runs the nth-most-recent command (for example, `!-2` repeats the command before last).
- **`!<command>`** — re-runs the most recent command starting with that command name.
- **`!<command>:p`** — prints the command that would be executed, without actually running it.
- **`CTRL+R`** — opens the _reverse incremental search_ mode to quickly recall past commands by typing partial matches.
- **`CTRL+G`** — exits the reverse search mode without running anything.
- **`history -d <number>`** — deletes a specific command entry from history by its number.
- **`history -c`** — clears the entire command history for the current session.

To prevent a command from being saved in your history, prefix it with a **space**.  
This behavior is controlled by the **`HISTCONTROL`** environment variable, which defines how Bash handles command recording:

- **`HISTCONTROL=ignorespace`** — skips recording any command that begins with a space.
- **`HISTCONTROL=ignoredups`** — skips recording duplicate consecutive commands.
- **`HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth`** — applies both `ignorespace` and `ignoredups`.

For better tracking, you can include **timestamps** in your command history by setting:
```
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%Y %T "
```

This formats each history entry with the date and time (day/month/year and 24-hour clock).

Example output after enabling timestamps:
```
  120  22/10/2025 11:04:12 ls -la
  121  22/10/2025 11:05:01 ranger
```

This makes it easier to audit or review what was done and when.
