## Timestamps

Every file in Linux maintains **three timestamps** that record different kinds of activity:
* **Access time (atime)** — updated when the file is read.
* **Modified time (mtime)** — updated when the file’s content changes.
* **Changed time (ctime)** — updated when file metadata changes (permissions, ownership, links, etc.).

### Viewing Timestamps

You can check these timestamps using `stat` or with `ls` options:
* `stat {file/directory}` — shows full timestamp details.
* `ls -l` — displays standard file listing with mtime.
* `ls -lt` — sort by modification time.
* `ls -lu` — show and sort by access time.
* `ls -lc` — show and sort by change time.

`ls` may shorten timestamps. To see the full format, use:
```
ls --full-time
```

### Changing Timestamps with `touch`

The `touch` command updates timestamps.
If the file doesn’t exist, `touch` creates it.
* `touch -a {file}` — update access time (this also updates ctime, because metadata changed).
* `touch -m {file}` — update modified time.
* `touch -m -t YYYYMMDDhhmmss {file}` — set mtime to a specific timestamp.
* `touch -a -t YYYYMMDDhhmmss {file}` — set atime to a specific timestamp.
* `touch -d "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss" {file}` — more readable date format.
* `touch {target_file} -r {reference_file}` — copy timestamps from one file to another.

### About ctime

You can’t directly modify **ctime**, because it updates automatically when metadata changes.
To indirectly influence it, you could adjust the **system clock** and then use:
```
touch {file}
```
This makes the file’s timestamps reflect whatever system time was set at that moment.
