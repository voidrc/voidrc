Linux systems have two main categories of users: **root (superuser)** and **normal users**. Understanding the difference between them is essential for managing permissions, security, and system operations.

### **Root User (Superuser)**

The **root** user is the system administrator with **unrestricted access** to all commands, files, and settings.  
They can modify system configurations, install or remove software, and manage other users.

- **Username:** `root`
- **Home Directory:** `/root`
- **Default Shell:** usually `/bin/bash`
- **User ID (UID):** `0` (this uniquely identifies the root account)

**Root Access Groups:**
On most systems, the root privileges are associated with groups like:
- `root`
- `wheel` (used on Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
- `sudo` (used on Ubuntu and Debian)

Users added to one of these groups can perform administrative tasks via `sudo`.

---

### **Normal (Regular) Users**

Normal users have limited permissions and can only modify files they own.  
They cannot directly change system settings or affect other users’ data.

- **Home Directory:** `/home/<username>`    
- **UID Range:** Typically starts from `1000` for the first created user
- **Default Shell:** Usually `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`

Regular users can temporarily gain administrative privileges using `sudo`, if permitted.

---

### **Using `sudo`**

`sudo` (superuser do) allows an authorized user to execute commands with elevated privileges **without switching to the root account**.  
Each `sudo` action is logged for auditing and safety.

**Examples:**

```
sudo apt update
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Configuration of who can use `sudo` is managed in `/etc/sudoers` or via the `visudo` command.

---

### **Switching Between Users**

To **switch users**, the `su` (substitute user) or `sudo` command can be used.

**Examples:**

- Switch to root:
```bash
su -
```

- Switch to another user:
```bash
su <username>
```

- Run a single command as another user:
```bash
sudo -u <username> <command>
```

To **check which user** you are currently logged in as:
```bash
whoami
```

In short words:

| User Type       | Home Directory     | UID     | Privileges   | Common Groups                |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **root**        | `/root`            | `0`     | Full control | `root`, `wheel`, `sudo`      |
| **Normal User** | `/home/<username>` | `≥1000` | Limited      | `users`, `sudo` (if granted) |
> Root is powerful but risky — a single mistake can break the system.  
> Best practice: operate as a normal user for daily tasks, and only escalate to root when absolutely necessary.
