## 📌 Summary
Brief overview of the concept.

## ⚠️ Warnings Before You Begin

- Incorrect flashing can permanently damage your motherboard.
    
- Make sure you **back up the original BIOS** before flashing.
    
- You may void your warranty.
    
- Use **exactly the correct BIOS file** for your motherboard model and revision.

## 🧰 What You Need

1. **CH341A Mini Programmer** (usually USB-based)
    
2. **SOIC8 Clip** (if your BIOS chip is soldered onto the motherboard)
    
3. **CH341A Software** (or alternative like AsProgrammer or flashrom)
    
4. **Correct BIOS file** for your motherboard
    
5. Optional: **Multimeter** (to check for correct pin contact)

## 🧭 Step-by-Step Guide

### 🔌 1. Identify and Locate Your BIOS Chip

- Look for an **8-pin chip** on your motherboard labeled with part numbers like `25Q32`, `25Q64`, `MXIC`, etc.
    
- Use a flashlight and magnifier if needed.
    
- Note the **orientation** (pin 1 is usually marked with a dot or a notch).
    

---

### 🔄 2. Prepare the Programmer

#### a. Connect the SOIC8 clip:

- Attach it to the BIOS chip **while the PC is powered off and unplugged**.
    
- Make sure **pin 1 on the clip matches pin 1 on the chip**.
    

#### b. Insert the clip connector into the CH341A device.

- If your chip is desoldered, insert it directly into the ZIF socket (match pin 1).
    

#### c. Plug the CH341A into a USB port.

### 💻 3. Install Software

#### Windows:

- Download CH341A Programmer (older version) or **AsProgrammer** (better compatibility).
    
- Run as Administrator.
    
- Select the correct chip model manually if it's not auto-detected.
    

#### Linux/macOS:

- Use [`flashrom`](https://flashrom.org/Flashrom).
    
    ```bash
    sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -r backup.rom  # To read
    sudo flashrom -p ch341a_spi -w newbios.rom  # To write
    ```
    

---

### 🧪 4. Back Up Current BIOS

- In the software, click **Read**.
    
- Save the read file (e.g., `backup.rom`)—this is your original BIOS.
    

---

### 💾 5. Load and Flash New BIOS

- Load the correct `.bin` file (some vendors provide `.cap` or `.exe`—you may need to extract `.bin`).
    
- Click **Erase**, then **Write**, then **Verify**.
    
- Wait for confirmation (may take a few minutes).
    

---

### 🔌 6. Reassemble and Boot

- Unplug the CH341A.
    
- Remove the clip.
    
- Plug the power back into the motherboard and try booting.
    
- Clear CMOS (reset BIOS) by removing the battery for 10 seconds if needed.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

|Problem|Solution|
|---|---|
|Chip not detected|Check clip contact, try re-orienting it|
|Write failed|Try using a different version of software or check for write protection|
|Board not booting|Double-check you used the correct BIOS for your board model|
