**Estimated Cost**:
- CPU+board: ~$12k–15k    
- GPU: $8.5k (Blackwell) → future Rubin adds ~+10%
- RAM: $2k+ for 512GB+ ECC
- Cooling/Case/Storage/PSU: ~$3k–5k      

> **Total**: ~$25k+ for absolute peak — scale down if needed

This builds a **true data center-in-a-box**: massive AI workloads, 100-player Minecraft servers, 4K streaming, remote access, honeypots—all water-cooled, top-tier. If you want cutting-edge and future-proof, wait for **Rubin GPUs** and **TR 9000 CPUs** in early 2026.

## Budget Friendly (Balanced Performance Beast – ~$2,000 to $3,000)

| Component        | Recommendation                                                | Why                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CPU**          | **AMD Ryzen 9 7950X** (16C/32T) OR **Intel i9‑14900K**        | High single-thread for Minecraft + multicore for services |
| **Motherboard**  | B650/X670 (AMD) or Z790 (Intel)                               | DDR5, PCIe 5.0 support, plenty of SATA/NVMe               |
| **RAM**          | 64–128GB DDR5 (2×32GB or 4×32GB, 5600+ MHz)                   | Enough for containers, Minecraft, honeypots               |

| **PSU**          | 850W Gold or Platinum                                         | Reliable power, future-proofed for upgrades               |
| **Case**         | Mid-tower with great airflow (Fractal Design, Phanteks, etc.) | Easy access and thermals                                  |
| **Cooling**      | Noctua NH-D15 (air) or AIO 360mm (Corsair, Arctic)            | Keeps CPU cool under load                                 |
| **Networking**   | Onboard 2.5Gbps + optional 10Gb NIC (Intel X550, etc.)        | Local lab transfers + remote access                       |

### What It Will Handle
- Minecraft Server (Spigot/Paper/Forge/Fabric) with 50+ players, 15–20 mods

- Full Linux server stack (Arch/Proxmox) with:    
    - NGINX reverse proxy
    - Docker/Podman containers
    - WireGuard + OpenVPN
    - Tor hidden services
    - Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Bitwarden, C2 servers (Covenant, Mythic, etc.)
- Enterprise-like network simulation: AD domain + CTF VMs (via Proxmox/VMWare)
- More than powerful enough for everything except AI/LLM work
- Expandable
- Manageable on a budget under ~$3K
- Quiet enough for home use, powerful enough to scare casual gamers

### Optional Upgrades
- **ECC RAM + workstation board** if you want maximum uptime
- **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)** — you’re running services, not a hairdryer
- **Rackmount chassis** if you’re building out a bigger lab later
