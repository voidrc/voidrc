# .voidrc

this is my archive of operations in cyber-security. some tools survived, some didn’t. either way, the wreckage is here for future looters.

---

## what’s inside (conceptual)

- **arsenal** → unstable tools, half-baked [scripts](./Scripts/), working junk. _(use at your own risk)_
- **transmissions** → short briefs, ops notes, cursed speedruns. ([starting point](./Ethical%20Hacking/01.%20Work%20Space.md))
- **treasure maps** → links, [road-maps](Resources/Root2Red.md).

---

## how to use (with brain)

1. **clone** → `git clone git@github.com:<you>/void-strike.git`
2. **stare** → at markdowns. feel nothing. run nothing.
3. **realize** → still nothing? maybe you cloned the wrong universe. research _Obsidian_ anyway.
