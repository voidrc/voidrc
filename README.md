# .voidrc

this is my archive of operations in cyber-security. some tools survived, some didn’t. either way, the wreckage is here for future looters. 

---

## what’s inside (conceptual)

- **arsenal** → unstable tools, half-baked [scripts](./Scripts/), working junk. *(use at your own risk)*  
- **transmissions** → short briefs, ops notes, cursed speedruns. ([starting point](./Ethical%20Hacking/01.%20Work%20Space.md))
- **treasure maps** → links, [resources](./Resources/), road-maps.

---

## how to use (with brain)

1. **clone** → `git clone git@github.com:<you>/void-strike.git`  
2. **stare** → at markdowns. feel nothing. run nothing.  
3. **realize** → still nothing? maybe you cloned the wrong universe. research *Obsidian* anyway.
