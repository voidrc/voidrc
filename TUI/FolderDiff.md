If you want to compare **two directories full of scripts** (Python, Bash, C/C++, Markdown, etc.) and see what changed — file additions, deletions, line-level diffs — you’ve got several options, from ancient and reliable to absurdly beautiful.

---

### 1. The old titan: **diff -r**

This is the POSIX workhorse. It’s fast, always available, and surprisingly flexible.

```bash
diff -r dir1 dir2
```

Adds `-q` for quiet (just tells you which files differ), or `-y` for side-by-side.

```bash
diff -rq dir1 dir2            # list only which files differ
diff -ry --suppress-common-lines dir1 dir2 | less -R
```

**Pros:** always installed, machine-parsable, perfect for scripting.
**Cons:** ugly output, no syntax highlighting, no sense of “structure.”

---

### 2. The enhanced diff gods

#### **1. diff-so-fancy + git diff**

Even outside git, you can use `git diff --no-index` to diff two directories.

```bash
git diff --no-index dir1 dir2 | diff-so-fancy
```

**Pros:** highlights additions/deletions, great colors.
**Cons:** linear output (no folder tree).

#### **2. delta (modern + sexy)**

`delta` prettifies diffs *and* works recursively via `git diff --no-index`.

```bash
git diff --no-index dir1 dir2 | delta --side-by-side
```

Add `--navigate` to move between changes with arrow keys.

**Pros:** colorized, syntax aware, side-by-side.
**Cons:** doesn’t summarize directory structure by default.

#### **3. difftastic (AST-based, code aware)**

This one’s smart — it parses code structurally. So if you move a function or change indentation, it highlights *logical* differences, not just textual ones.

```bash
difft dir1 dir2
```

(Or explicitly:)

```bash
difftastic --context 5 dir1 dir2
```

**Pros:** understands dozens of programming languages.
**Cons:** slower, overkill for text or non-code files.

### 3. For the whole-tree comparison view

#### **1. diffoscope**

A monster diff tool designed for comparing *everything*, from binaries to folders to ISOs.

```bash
diffoscope dir1 dir2
```

**Pros:** shows deep comparisons, recurses into archives, PDFs, binaries.
**Cons:** slower than a drunken rsync; not great for interactive browsing.

#### **2. rsync dry-run trick**

A neat hack: `rsync` can tell you which files would be changed if syncing two directories.

```bash
rsync -rvn --delete dir1/ dir2/
```

**Pros:** perfect for finding *which files differ* before doing actual diffs.
**Cons:** doesn’t show line-level changes.

---

### 4. Interactive TUIs

#### **1. vimdiff recursively**

Combine find + vimdiff:

```bash
for f in $(cd dir1 && find . -type f); do
    if [ -f "dir2/$f" ]; then
        vimdiff "dir1/$f" "dir2/$f"
    fi
done
```

You can wrap that into your TUI: each file opens in side-by-side diff mode.

#### **2. TUI wrappers**

You could also use **`ydiff`** or **`icdiff`** for line-level color diffs inside your terminal window.

```bash
icdiff --recursive dir1 dir2
```

---

### 5. My favorite combo (for TUI project)

Here’s the combo I’d wire in:

1. Use `rsync -rvn --delete dir1/ dir2/` to generate the list of changed files.
2. Feed that list into a loop that calls:

   ```bash
   difftastic fileA fileB | less -R
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   delta --side-by-side fileA fileB
   ```
3. Display the summary tree in your Textual interface, with keybindings:

   * Enter → open detailed diff
   * Space → mark file for sync or merge
   * M → launch editor to resolve conflict

You’ll end up with a **TUI Meld** that’s fast, curses-based, and extensible.
